The IRS has announced that players can deduct up to $600 of their casino winnings as a result of playing Snowborn slots.</p>
<p>To qualify, taxpayers must have itemized deductions and must have Documented Wagering Losses (Form 1040, Schedule A). The deduction is available for all wagers placed in a calendar year, including those placed at traditional brick-and-mortar casinos, online casinos, and race tracks.</p>
<p>“We are excited to offer this new deduction to our players,” said Snowborn CEO John Davidson. “Snowborn has become one of the most popular slots games in the world and we are happy to give our fans another way to enjoy it.”</p>
<p>The deduction is available immediately and can be claimed when taxpayers file their 2018 tax returns.</p>
<h1 id="New-Microgaming-Slot-Means-Big-Tax-Deductions-For-Canadian-Players"><a href="#New-Microgaming-Slot-Means-Big-Tax-Deductions-For-Canadian-Players" class="headerlink" title="New Microgaming Slot Means Big Tax Deductions For Canadian Players"></a>New Microgaming Slot Means Big Tax Deductions For Canadian Players</h1><p>This April, Canadian online casino players can look forward to a new Microgaming slot that offers big tax deductions. The game, called “King Tut’s Chamber,” is based on the life and times of the young pharaoh. It offers players a chance to explore his golden palace and claim generous payouts along the way.</p>
<p>But the best part of this new slot may be its potential for tax deductions. That’s because Canadian players can deduct their gambling losses from their taxable income. So if you happen to go on a losing streak while playing King Tut’s Chamber, don’t worry – you can still write those losses off on your taxes.</p>
<p>Just make sure you keep good records of your play time and net losses. That way, you can be sure to get the most out of your tax deduction.</p>
<p>In addition to its tax benefits, King Tut’s Chamber also offers some great gameplay features. These include wild symbols, scatters, free spins, and a bonus round. So whether you’re looking for big payouts or tax deductions, this new slot has something for everyone.</p>
<p>So make sure you check it out when it hits online casinos this April!</p>
<h1 id="Get-Ready-To-Deduct-Your-Winnings-Snowborn-Slot-Lovers"><a href="#Get-Ready-To-Deduct-Your-Winnings-Snowborn-Slot-Lovers" class="headerlink" title="Get Ready To Deduct Your Winnings, Snowborn Slot Lovers!"></a>Get Ready To Deduct Your Winnings, Snowborn Slot Lovers!</h1><p>A few weeks ago we let you in on a little secret – the brand new Snowborn slot game from Booming Games. We told you that this one was definitely worth trying out, and many of you heeded our advice, taking to the icy reels for some winter fun!</p>
<p>Now that the game’s popularity has well and truly snowballed, we wanted to give you a few handy hints on how to make the most of your time playing. After all, it would be a shame not to pocket those wins when they come your way!</p>
<p>Here are our top tips for players of the Snowborn slot game: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Be patient! This may seem like common sense, but too often we get carried away with Bonus rounds and forget that the key to success in this game is patience. Take your time to assess each situation and make sure you know what’s going on before making any rash decisions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Utilise the Wild symbols! As always, the Wild symbol is your friend, so make sure you use it to your advantage where possible. It can help you create winning combinations more easily and can also act as a substitute for other symbols to boost your payouts.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don’t forget about the Free Spins round! This is one of the busiest and most lucrative rounds in the game, so make sure you save it for last – especially if you’re aiming for that elusive jackpot prize!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Check out the bonus features! The Bonus features in Snowborn are definitely worth exploring, as they can help increase your winnings considerably. Make sure you take advantage of these whenever possible and aim for those all-important bonus rounds.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Have fun! Above all else, remember to have fun while playing Snowborn slot. After all, it’s meant to be a quick winter diversion rather than a slog towards riches – though hopefully both will be enjoyed along the way!</p>

<h1 id="Microgaming’s-New-Snowborn-Slot-Could-Mean-Major-Tax-Deductions-For-Players"><a href="#Microgaming’s-New-Snowborn-Slot-Could-Mean-Major-Tax-Deductions-For-Players" class="headerlink" title="Microgaming’s New Snowborn Slot Could Mean Major Tax Deductions For Players"></a>Microgaming’s New Snowborn Slot Could Mean Major Tax Deductions For Players</h1><p>Snowborn is a new slot game released by leading online casino software provider Microgaming. The game is a 5-reel, 243-payline offering with stunning graphics and animations that players are sure to love. But the most exciting thing about Snowborn may be its potential for tax deductions.</p>
<p>Thanks to its unique Avalanche feature, every time a winning combination lands on the reels, the symbols involved will disappear and be replaced by new symbols falling from above. This can create multiple new wins with each spin, making for some seriously big payouts. And because the Avalanche feature keeps going until no more winning combinations can form, it’s possible to amass some absolutely massive payouts.</p>
<p>But here’s where things get really interesting: those massive payouts could lead to some pretty significant tax deductions for players. That’s because in many jurisdictions, gambling winnings are considered taxable income. But thanks to the Avalanche feature and its ability to create multiple winning combinations with each spin, players could easily rack up enough deductions to completely wipe out their gambling winnings.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for a slot game that not only offers great entertainment but also the potential for some major tax savings, Snowborn is definitely worth checking out.</p>
<h1 id="Canadian-Slots-Fans-Win-Again-This-Time-With-Tax-Deductions"><a href="#Canadian-Slots-Fans-Win-Again-This-Time-With-Tax-Deductions" class="headerlink" title="Canadian Slots Fans Win Again - This Time With Tax Deductions!"></a>Canadian Slots Fans Win Again - This Time With Tax Deductions!</h1><p>It’s been a good year for Canadian slots fans, what with the smashing success of games like <slot game name> and <slot game name>. Now, to add to the good news, comes word that Canadian slots fans can claim tax deductions on their gaming losses!</p>
<p>That’s right – as long as you can substantiate your losses (e.g. keep records of your play), you may be able to deduct a portion of those losses from your taxable income. This could be a big help to players who find themselves in a bit of a financial bind.</p>
<p>So how does it work? Basically, you can deduct up to 50% of your slots losses each year, subject to certain limits. And if you happen to have net losses in more than one year, you can carry them forward and deduct them against future income.</p>
<p>This is great news for Canadian slots fans, many of whom are already struggling with high levels of personal debt. So why not take advantage of this tax deduction and put some money back in your pocket? It’s easy to do – just make sure you keep good records of your play and speak to your accountant about claiming these deductions.</p>
