The key to winning at this game is to make sure you hit the right combinations on the payline. The simplest way to do this is to line up three matching symbols on the payline. The following table shows all of the possible combinations and their corresponding payouts:

Symbol 1 Coin 2 Coins 3 Coins
 Ace $200 $400 $600 King $100 $200 $300 Queen $75 $150 $225 Jack $50 $100 $150 Ten $25 $50 $75 Nine $20 $40 $60 Two Aces* N/A N/A 2,000** *Only appears on second reel. **Maximum payout if betting three coins.

As you can see, the highest payout in the game is 2,000 coins for landing three Two Aces symbols on the payline. However, as we mentioned earlier, it's important to remember that you must be betting three coins in order to qualify for this payout.

Now that we've covered the basics of playing Two Aces slot machine, let's move on to some tips that will help increase your chances of winning big bucks!

Tip #2: Try using smaller bets to increase your chances of winning multiple times in a row. Big wins are always exciting but they can also be few and far between. If you're looking to increase your chances of winning without risking too much money, try using smaller bets and betting multiple times per spin instead of just once. This way, even if you don't hit a big win on your first try, you could still come away with a nice prize by hitting it a few times in a row!
