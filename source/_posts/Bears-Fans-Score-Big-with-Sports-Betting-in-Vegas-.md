#  Bears Fans Score Big with Sports Betting in Vegas 

The Chicago Bears have been a football powerhouse throughout their history. This has led to many devoted fans of the team across the United States. Recently, some of those fans have turned to sports betting in Las Vegas to score big wins on game days.

Bears fans are not alone when it comes to taking their fandom to the next level with sports betting. In fact, Nevada sports books took in $4.86 billion worth of bets in 2017. Of that amount, $118 million was wagered on NFL games, with nearly half of that amount – or $55.3 million – coming from bettors who placed wagers on individual games.

While it’s impossible to know exactly how much money Chicago Bears fans won and lost on game days last year, it’s clear that they are making their presence felt in Las Vegas sports books. And with the Bears looking like a contender once again this season, there is no doubt that their fans will be busy placing bets in Sin City over the next few months.

#  How Chicago Bears Fans Can Win at Sports Betting in Vegas 

Chicago Bears NFL fans who are looking to make a little money on the side by gambling on their favorite team’s games while in Las Vegas should definitely read this guide first! Just like with any other type of gambling, there is some risk involved when betting on sports, but if you follow these tips you can tilt the odds more in your favor.

First and foremost, it’s important to do your research and know as much as possible about the teams playing and the matchup. A good place to start is with websites like Oddsshark or Pro-Football-Reference, which have all sorts of data including past results, statistics and odds. Another key is to identify any “bad lines” being offered by the casinos – these are bets where the house has an artificially high edge. By avoiding these bad lines and only placing bets where you have a decent chance of winning, you can minimize your risks.

One final tip is to always use sound money management techniques. This means not betting too much money on any one game, and always having a backup plan in case you lose (e.g., betting smaller amounts on future games). If you stick to these guidelines, you’ll be well on your way to successful sports betting while in Vegas!

#  Expert Tips for Betting on the Chicago Bears in Vegas 
Now that the Chicago Bears have finally had their first winning season in quite some time, they’re a team to watch in the coming year—especially if you’re thinking of betting on them while in Vegas. 

If you want to make some money off of the Bears in Vegas, here are a few expert tips to follow: 

First and foremost, be sure to check the Bears’ injury reports before placing your bets. Unlike some teams, the Bears tend to be very open about their players’ injuries, so you can get a good sense of who is likely to play and who is not. 

Secondly, remember that the Bears are still relatively young and inexperienced. This means that they are not always consistent from week to week. So if you see that they are playing a strong team this week, it may be wiser not to bet on them. 

Finally, keep an eye on quarterback Mitchell Trubisky. He had an impressive rookie year last season and is only going to get better with more experience. If he continues to play well, the Bears stand a good chance of winning even against stronger opponents.

#  Can the Chicago Bears cover the spread in Vegas?

The Chicago Bears will head to Nevada this weekend to take on the Raiders in an important Week 7 matchup. Vegas has set the line for this game at Raiders -4.5, and many are wondering if the Bears can cover that spread.

After starting the season off 2-1, the Bears have since gone on a three-game losing streak. In their last game, they were demolished by the Patriots 38-31. Mitchell Trubisky threw for 333 yards and two touchdowns in that game, but he also had three interceptions. The Bears’ defense was not able to stop Tom Brady and the Patriots offense, which is concerning given that they will be going up against Derek Carr and the Raiders this weekend.

The Raiders come into this game with a 3-4 record. However, they have won their last two games, both of which were at home. In their last game, they beat the Cleveland Browns 45-42. Derek Carr threw for 437 yards and four touchdowns in that game. The Raiders’ offense is definitely capable of putting up points, so the Bears’ defense will need to play well if they want to win this game.

Chicago has not been very good on the road this season. They are 1-2 away from home, with their only win coming against the Arizona Cardinals in Week 2. The Bears are also going up against a very good Raiders team, so it will be tough for them to pull off the upset victory.

All things considered, it seems like the odds are stacked against the Bears in this game. The spread is set at Raiders -4.5, and most experts believe that Oakland will cover that spread. However, anything can happen in a football game, so don’t rule out a Chicago upset just yet
