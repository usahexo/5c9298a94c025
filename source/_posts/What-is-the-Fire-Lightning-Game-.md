#  What is the Fire Lightning Game? 
The Fire Lightning Game is one of the best known games Chinese children love to play. It is a simple game that can be played with any number of players. The aim is to catch as many fireflies as possible using a net.

To start, everyone gathers in a circle, and one player is chosen to be the first firefly. That player then walks around the inside of the circle and secretly selects someone to be their target. Once they have selected their target, they run towards them and try to catch them with their net. If they catch their target, then the player becomes the new firefly and chooses someone else to target. If they miss, then they become the new target for the next player.

The game continues until there is only one player left, who is declared the winner.
