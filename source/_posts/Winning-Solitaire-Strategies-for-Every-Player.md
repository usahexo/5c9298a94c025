#  Winning Solitaire Strategies for Every Player

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced player, there are solitaire strategies that can help you win more often. In this article, we'll explore some of the most effective tactics for each type of solitaire game.

** Klondike **

The most classic and well-known solitaire game is Klondike. For this game, your goal is to build all four suits in ascending order from Ace to King. There are a few different techniques that can help you win at Klondike:

- When dealing the cards, try to keep the pairs together. This will make it easier to create runs in each suit.

- Use the « reserve » column to hold cards that can help you build your suits.

- If you have a card that's one away from being in sequence (e.g. a 6 of Clubs that needs a 7), move it to the reserve column and place another card on top of it to remember its position. That way, you won't accidentally put the card back into play before you're ready.

- When building your suits, don't be afraid to use wildcards (Jokers or 2s). They can help you fill in any gaps in your sequence.

** Yukon **
In Yukon, the goal is to build each suit separately in ascending order, starting with the 2s. There are a few things that can help you win this game:

- Try to keep all of the low cards together so that you can easily build your suits up.

- Use the « reserve » column to hold cards that can help you build your suits. You may also want to use extra spaces in the tableau for this purpose.

- If you have a card that's one away from being in sequence (e.g. a 6 of Clubs that needs a 7), move it to the reserve column and place another card on top of it to remember its position. That way, you won't accidentally put the card back into play before you're ready.
