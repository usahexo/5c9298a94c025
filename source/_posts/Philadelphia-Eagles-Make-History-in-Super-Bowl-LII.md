#  Philadelphia Eagles Make History in Super Bowl LII

The Philadelphia Eagles made NFL history by winning the Super Bowl for the first time in their franchise’s existence. The Lombardi trophy has finally come to Philadelphia! The Eagles played an amazing game and beat the New England Patriots 41-33.

This was a back-and-forth contest that came down to the final minutes. The Eagles were led by their backup quarterback Nick Foles, who stepped up in a big way and was named MVP of the game. Foles completed 28 of 43 passes for 373 yards and three touchdowns.

The Eagles got off to a hot start, scoring on their very first possession. They would go on to score another touchdown in the second quarter, and take a 14-3 lead into halftime. But the Patriots would not go down without a fight. They scored 24 unanswered points in the second half, taking a 27-24 lead late in the fourth quarter.

But then Foles led the Eagles on an impressive 88-yard drive that culminated in a touchdown pass to Zach Ertz with less than two minutes remaining. This gave Philadelphia a 38-33 lead, and they would hold on to win the game.

Wide receiver Alshon Jeffery was one of the stars for Philadelphia, catching five passes for 85 yards and two touchdowns. Tight end Ertz was also impressive, catching seven passes for 67 yards and one touchdown.

The Eagles’ defense also played well, sacking Patriots quarterback Tom Brady four times and intercepting him once. This is only the third time that Brady has been sacked four times in a Super Bowl game.

This was an exciting Super Bowl that had everything – close games, big plays, fantastic finishes – and it will be remembered as one of the best ever. The Philadelphia Eagles are now champions of the NFL world!

#  What Does PK Stand For In Sports Bets For Philadelphia Eagles?

As American football fans gear up for the [Super Bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl), many are wondering what PK stands for when it comes to betting on the Philadelphia Eagles. 

PK or point spread is a common term when betting on American football games. The point spread is the margin of points by which the favourite is expected to win the game. So, for example, if the Eagles are playing against the New England Patriots and the point spread is set at -7 for the Eagles, this means that New England is favoured to win by 7 points or more. If you bet on Philadelphia, they would need to win by 8 points or more for you to win your bet. 

Conversely, if you bet on New England in this scenario, their victory would have to be by less than 7 points in order for you to win your bet. The point spread can also go the other way and be set at +7 if Philadelphia is seen as the underdog in a game. 

There are numerous other bets that can be placed when wagering on American football games such as who will score first, total number of points scored and whether either team will cover the point spread. Make sure you do your research before placing any bets though as sports betting can be a risky endeavour!

#  Eagles Win Super Bowl, But What Does PK Mean In Betting?

The Philadelphia Eagles are the champions of the National Football League (NFL) after they defeated the New England Patriots 41-33 in Super Bowl LII. In one of the most thrilling Super Bowl games in history, quarterback Nick Foles led the Eagles to an upset victory over Tom Brady and the Patriots.

Despite being underdogs going into the game, Eagles fans were confident their team could pull off the upset. And they were right – Philadelphia is now NFL champion for the first time since 1960.

For those that bet on the game, what did “PK” mean in betting? PK stands for “pick’em”, which is a bet where you either pick the winner or choose that the game will end in a draw (tie). So if you bet on PK, you would have won money if the game ended in a tie.

However, because the Eagles won 41-33, anyone that bet on Philadelphia at +3 would have also won their bet. This is because they would have won by more than three points even if New England had managed to score a touchdown in the final seconds of regulation to tie the game up.

While this was an exciting Super Bowl game, it was also a very profitable one for those that wagered on it. Thanks to some last minute drama, there were plenty of winning bets heading into overtime.
