#  Delaware becomes first state to legalize sports gambling

On June 5, 2018, the Delaware Senate passed a bill that would legalize sports gambling in the state. The House of Representatives had already passed the bill on June 1. Delaware Governor John Carney is expected to sign the bill into law, making Delaware the first state in the nation to legalize sports gambling.

The bill authorizes casinos and racetracks in Delaware to offer bets on professional and college sports, including football, basketball, baseball, and hockey. It also allows betting on other sporting events, such as golf and auto racing.

Proponents of the bill say that it will create jobs and generate revenue for the state. They point out that sports betting is already happening illegally in Delaware, so it makes sense to legalize and regulate it.

Opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to gambling addiction and other social ills. They also argue that legalizing sports betting will not produce significant revenue for the state.

Delaware is not alone in its efforts to legalize sports gambling. Several other states, including New Jersey, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania, are also considering similar measures.

#  Nevada remains the only state where sports gambling is legal

The United States Supreme Court announced on Monday that it would not take up the New Jersey case to legalize sports gambling, meaning that Nevada will remain the only state where sports gambling is legal.

This is a major blow to New Jersey and its governor, Phil Murphy, who campaigned on legalizing sports gambling in order to help revive the state's struggling casino industry. The state had already lost at every step of the legal process, with the Supreme Court declining to hear the case in December 2017 and again on Monday.

In response to Monday's decision, Murphy said that he was "disappointed but not surprised" and that the state would continue to push for legalization.

Monday's decision was also a defeat for the National Football League (NFL) and other professional sports leagues, which had fought against legalization. The NFL argued that legalizing sports gambling could harm the integrity of its games.

There is no word yet on whether New Jersey will try to legalize sports gambling through legislation or lawsuits.

#  Pennsylvania moves closer to legalizing sports gambling

Pennsylvania lawmakers have taken a major step forward in the process of legalizing sports gambling in the state.

The House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly in favor of a bill that would allow casinos and racetracks to offer sports betting. The measure passed by a vote of 179-10, with bipartisan support.

The bill now heads to the Senate for consideration. If it is approved, it would then go to Governor Tom Wolf for his signature.

Pennsylvania is one of several states where sports gambling is currently illegal, but there is growing momentum to change that. In May, the Supreme Court struck down a federal law that had prohibited most states from legalizing sports betting.

Since then, several states have moved to legalize the activity. West Virginia became the first state to do so after the Supreme Court decision, and Delaware followed soon thereafter.

Many other states are expected to take similar action in the coming months and years.

 Supporters of legalization argue that it will generate new revenue for state government and create jobs. They also say that it will provide a new source of entertainment for residents and visitors alike.

 opponents of legalization argue that it could lead to increased addiction problems and other social ills. They also contend that it will hurt the integrity of sporting events.

#  Sports gambling legality expanding as more states consider legislation

States are increasingly legalizing sports gambling as a way to generate revenue, and the legality of the activity is expanding. The practice was legalized in Nevada in 1949, and Delaware followed suit in 2009. New Jersey won a Supreme Court case in 2018 that allowed it to legalize sports betting, and other states are now considering similar measures.

The legalization of sports gambling is opposed by some who argue that it is a form of gambling that particularly targets athletes and fans,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) and that it can lead to corruption in the sport industry. However, others argue that the activity should be legalized on the grounds of personal freedom, and that it can be regulated to protect consumers.

The trend towards legalizing sports gambling is likely to continue as more states consider the measure. This could have implications for the sport industry, as well as for consumers who may want to bet on sporting events.

#  States continue to debate the legality of sports gambling

#

# The United States Supreme Court struck down a federal law in May 2018 that had prohibited most states from authorizing sports gambling, opening the door for legalized sports betting in many states. The decision marked a victory for New Jersey, which had been battling the law since 2011.

#

# Since the Supreme Court’s ruling, a number of states have moved to legalize some form of sports gambling. On July 9, 2018, Delaware became the first state to offer full-scale sports betting, followed by New Jersey on July 16. Some other states, including Pennsylvania and West Virginia, have also moved quickly to pass legislation authorizing sports betting in anticipation of revenues from the activity.

#

# The rush to legalize sports gambling has not been without controversy, however. Critics argue that the activity can lead to addiction and other social ills, and they question whether the benefits of legalizing it outweigh the risks. Supporters of legalization argue that it will bring new revenue to states and create jobs, while also providing consumers with a safe and legal way to place bets on sporting events.

# The debate over whether to legalize sports gambling is likely to continue as more states move to authorize it. In the meantime, bettors can already place bets on sporting events in a number of states where it is now legal.
