"Jrue is one of our core players and we are excited to have him back next season," said Pelicans general manager Dell Demps. "He is a two-time All-Star and his experience and production on the court will be invaluable to our young team."

With the Pelicans having already exercised their team options on forwards Anthony Davis and Nikola Mirotic, as well as guard Elfrid Payton, they now have all of their key players under contract for next season.
