#  Barcelona Win Cup With Help of Goalkeeper Against Sevilla

Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-Andre Ter Stegen played a huge role in his team's victory over Sevilla in the Copa del Rey final on Saturday. The German made several impressive saves, including one in extra time, to help Barcelona win 5-4 on penalties after a 2-2 draw.

Barcelona were not at their best during the match, and they were fortunate that Sevilla missed a number of good chances. But they managed to take the lead in the first half thanks to a goal from Lionel Messi, and it looked like they would hold on for the win.

However, Sevilla equalized in the second half, and the match went into extra time. In the 112th minute, Ter Stegen came up with a superb save to deny Wissam Ben Yedder, and that proved to be decisive as Barcelona eventually won on penalties.

It was an emotional victory for Barcelona, who had lost to Madrid in last year's final. And it also capped off a memorable season for Ter Stegen, who has been one of the standout players for the club this year.

#  Barcelona Players Threaten to Boycott Cup Final If Manager Is Fired

The future of Barcelona manager, Luis Enrique is in doubt, after reports emerged that some of the club's players are threatening to boycott the Copa del Rey final if he is sacked.

Enrique is said to have lost the support of some of the senior players in the squad, after a disappointing season which has seen Barcelona knocked out of the Champions League at the hands of Juventus, and struggling to keep up with rivals Real Madrid in La Liga.

A group of players, including Gerard Pique, Andres Iniesta and Lionel Messi have reportedly told Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu that they will refuse to play in the final if Enrique is replaced.

"I don't know what will happen. I only know that we are very united and we don't want Luis Enrique to go," Pique said earlier this week.

Bartomeu has insisted that Enrique will be in charge for next season, but rumours continue to circulate that he could be replaced by either Ronald Koeman or former Barcelona player and current Athletic Bilbao manager Ernesto Valverde.

If Enrique does leave, it would be a major blow to Barcelona who have relied heavily on his tactical nous and man-management skills since he took over as manager in 2014. He has won two La Liga titles and one Champions League during his time at the club.

#  Neymar Jr. Scores Twice as Barcelona Beat Alaves to Win Copa del Rey

In a thrilling cup final, Neymar Jr. scored twice to help Barcelona overcome Alaves 3-1 and win the Copa del Rey. The Brazilian opened the scoring in the ninth minute, latching onto a Leo Messi pass and firing home from close range. Luis Suarez then made it 2-0 in the 25th minute with a cool finish from Neymar’s cross.

Alaves pulled one back just before halftime through Theo Hernandez, but Neymar restored Barcelona’s two-goal lead in the 59th minute with a powerful strike into the top corner. It was his 55th goal for Barcelona, placing him equal second on the club’s all-time scoring list alongside Laszlo Kubala.

Victory means that Barcelona have now won 28 major trophies under manager Luis Enrique – more than any other club in Europe during his tenure. “It’s been an incredible season, we’ve won everything,” said Enrique after the game. “I want to dedicate this title to everyone at the club, to our fans and to my family. I love them all very much.”

#  Barcelona’s Dembele out for Season After tearing hamstring

In a huge blow to Barcelona, French forward Ousmane Dembele is set to miss the remainder of the season after tearing his hamstring in Tuesday’s victory over Celta Vigo.

The 21-year-old, who joined from Borussia Dortmund in a €105million deal last summer, was substituted midway through the first half of the clash at the Camp Nou. Tests on Wednesday have since confirmed that he has sustained a significant hamstring injury.

Dembele’s absence is a huge blow to Barca boss Ernesto Valverde, who is now left with just Philippe Coutinho and Luis Suarez as his senior forwards. The Spanish champions are also through to the Champions League semi-finals, where they will face Liverpool.

Barca issued a statement on Wednesday afternoon confirming the extent of Dembele’s injury. “Ousmane Dembele has torn his hamstring and will be out for the next four months,” it read.

#  Messi: We Wanted to Prove We Are a Great Team Without Neymar

Lionel Messi has said that Barcelona wanted to prove they were a great team without Neymar following the Brazilian's world-record transfer to Paris Saint-Germain.

Messi, who scored twice in a 3-0 win over Athletic Bilbao on Saturday, said that the Spanish champions had worked hard in preseason to ensure they were able to cope without the 25-year-old.

"We wanted to show we were a great team even without Neymar," Messi told reporters after the game. "We knew he was important for us but we also knew that we could do well without him.

"It wasn't an easy situation but we've started well and now we have to continue like this."

Neymar quit Barcelona for PSG in a €222 million move earlier this month, and the Catalan club have been linked with a host of replacements, including Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele of Borussia Dortmund.
