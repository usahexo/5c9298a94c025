#  Gunspinners Gold Is the Oldest Casino in Las Vegas!

It is difficult to determine the precise origin of gambling, as games of chance have been played in various forms throughout history. Gambling fever gripped the American colonies in the early 1800s, and wit and wager soon became an integral part of social life. In 1829, the first legal casino opened in New Orleans. The birth of Las Vegas as a gambling mecca can be traced back to 1904, when Carlotta Montanari opened her Gunspinners Gold casino. At that time, it was the only casino in Las Vegas.

Gunspinners Gold originally consisted of a small single-story adobe building with six slot machines. Montanari's daughter, Josie Arlington, later took over management of the casino and made several additions, including a second story and a neon sign. Gunspinners Gold remained open 24 hours a day and quickly became a popular destination for people from all walks of life. Celebrities such as Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley were known to frequent the casino.
